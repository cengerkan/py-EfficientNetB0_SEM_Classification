# py-EfficientNetB0_SEM_Classification
Automatic classification of four types of nanomaterials (fibers, nanowires, particles, and powder) from SEM images using an EfficientNetB0-based DL model. This project offers a high-accuracy classification model using a transfer learning + fine-tuning approach and includes a confusion matrix, training graphs, and single image prediction functions.
